# Predicting-Risk
I worked on a projected where I built a model to predict a customer’s risk of repaying their debt.  The data for this project was gotten from Kaggle. The data consisted of over 700, 000 observations and over a 100 variable. I used different packages in R to clean up my data and reduce the dimension of the data. I built different models for this prediction, my final model was selected by comparing it’s accuracy and number of predictors to the others. The model with the least number of predictors and highest accuracy was selected. The consequence of this project is that it will help a credit company narrow down the attributes of a customer, that determines their ability to pay back a loan thus increasing their profit margin.
